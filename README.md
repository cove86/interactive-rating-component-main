## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I completed this quicker than expected and managed to complete the layout and javascript without having to use google or look at previous projects. (I did use a CSS button generator though!) Although a simple challenge I've become more confident in my abilities to create layouts and feel like my code is starting to get cleaner.
